  abstract = {The present paper is devoted to clustering geometric graphs. While the standard spectral clustering is often not effective for geometric graphs, we present an effective generalization, which we call higher-order spectral clustering. It resembles in concept the classical spectral clustering method but uses for partitioning the eigenvector associated with a higher-order eigenvalue. We establish the weak consistency of this algorithm for a wide class of geometric graphs which we call Soft Geometric Block Model. A small adjustment of the algorithm provides strong consistency. We also show that our method is effective in numerical experiments even for graphs of modest size.}

  abstract = {Classic network clustering tackles the problem of identifying sets of nodes (communities) that have similar connection patterns. However, in many scenarios nodes also have attributes that are correlated and can also be used to identify node clusters. Thus, network information (edges) and node information (attributes) can be jointly leveraged to design high-performance clustering algorithms. Under a general model for the network and node attributes, this work establishes an information-theoretic criteria for the exact recovery of community labels and characterizes a phase transition determined by the Chernoff-Hellinger divergence of the model. The criteria shows how network and attribute information can be exchanged in order to have exact recovery (e.g., more reliable network information requires less reliable attribute information). This work also presents an iterative clustering algorithm that maximizes the joint likelihood, assuming that the probability distribution of network interactions and node attributes belong to exponential families. This covers a broad range of possible interactions (e.g., edges with weights) and attributes (e.g., non-Gaussian models) while also exploring the connection between exponential families and Bregman divergences. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real data indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms algorithms that leverage only network or only attribute information as well as recently proposed algorithms that perform clustering using both sources of information. The contributions of this work provide insights into the fundamental limits and practical techniques for inferring community labels on node-attributed networks.},

  title={Why the Metric Backbone Preserves Community Structure},

  abstract = {The metric backbone of a weighted graph is the union of all-pairs shortest paths. It is obtained by removing all edges (u,v) that are not the shortest path between u and v. In networks with well-separated communities, the metric backbone tends to preserve many inter-community edges, because these edges serve as bridges connecting two communities, but tends to delete many intra-community edges because the communities are dense. This suggests that the metric backbone would dilute or destroy the community structure of the network. However, this is not borne out by prior empirical work, which instead showed that the metric backbone of real networks preserves the community structure of the original network well. In this work, we analyze the metric backbone of a broad class of weighted random graphs with communities, and we formally prove the robustness of the community structure with respect to the deletion of all the edges that are not in the metric backbone. An empirical comparison of several graph sparsification techniques confirms our theoretical finding and shows that the metric backbone is an efficient sparsifier in the presence of communities.},
