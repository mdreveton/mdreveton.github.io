I am a postdoctoral researcher at [INDY Lab](https://indy.epfl.ch), in EPFL, supervised by [Patrick Thiran](https://people.epfl.ch/patrick.thiran) and [Matthias Grossglauser](https://indy.epfl.ch/grossglauser/index.html). My research interests involve network analysis, especially graph clustering and random graphs. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science in 2022 from Inria Sophia Antipolis, under the supervision of [Konstantin Avratchenkov](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Konstantin.Avratchenkov/me.html).


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
