I am an Assistant Professor (Maître de Conférences) in Statistics at [Université Gustave-Eiffel](https://www.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr), and a member of [LAMA](https://lama-umr8050.fr) (Laboratoire d’analyse et de mathématiques appliquées).


Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [INDY Lab](https://indy.epfl.ch) at EPFL, supervised by [Patrick Thiran](https://people.epfl.ch/patrick.thiran) and [Matthias Grossglauser](https://indy.epfl.ch/grossglauser/index.html). I obtained my PhD in Computer Science in 2022 from Inria Sophia Antipolis, where I was supervised by [Konstantin Avrachenkov](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Konstantin.Avratchenkov/me.html). 

My research focuses on developing innovative algorithms and understanding the theoretical limits of the **identification of meaningful patterns and structures within large datasets**. I am particularly interested in **network analysis**, **community detection** and **clustering**. I also work on **graph sparsification**. 

Our book, [Statistical Analysis of Networks](https://nowpublishers.com/article/BookDetails/9781638280507), provides a general introduction to the statistical analysis of networks and present various concepts such as network modeling, community detection, graph-based semi-supervised learning, and sampling in networks. The book is available in open-access. 

Together with Daniel Ratton Figueiredo, I gave a tutorial on community detection at ACM SIGMETRICS / IFIP PERFORMANCE (June 10, 2024). A recording of the tutorial is available [here](https://www.cos.ufrj.br/~daniel/netclu/).

For those preparing for the Agrégation de Mathématiques, my earlier book [Leçons pour l’agrégation de mathématiques - Préparation à l’oral](https://www.editions-ellipses.fr/accueil/3543-lecons-pour-lagregation-de-mathematiques-preparation-a-loral-9782340030183.html) (in French) may be of interest.
