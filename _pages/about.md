I am a postdoctoral researcher at [INDY Lab](https://indy.epfl.ch), in EPFL, supervised by [Patrick Thiran](https://people.epfl.ch/patrick.thiran) and [Matthias Grossglauser](https://indy.epfl.ch/grossglauser/index.html). I obtained my PhD in Computer Science in 2022 from Inria Sophia Antipolis, under the supervision of [Konstantin Avrachenkov](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Konstantin.Avratchenkov/me.html). 

My research focuses on developing innovative algorithms and understanding the theoretical limits for the **identification of meaningful patterns and structures within large datasets**. I am particularly interested in **network analysis**, **community detection** and **clustering**. 

Our book [Statistical Analysis of Networks](https://nowpublishers.com/article/BookDetails/9781638280507) provides a general introduction to the statistical analysis of networks, and present various concepts such as network modeling, community detection, graph-based semi-supervised learning and sampling in networks. The book is available in open-access. 

I gave a tutorial on community detection with Daniel Ratton Figueiredo, at ACM SIGMETRICS / IFIP PERFORMANCE (June 10, 2024). Video of the tutorial is available [here](https://www.cos.ufrj.br/~daniel/netclu/).

People preparing for the Agrégation de Mathématiques can find my book [Leçons pour l’agrégation de mathématiques - Préparation à l’oral](https://www.editions-ellipses.fr/accueil/3543-lecons-pour-lagregation-de-mathematiques-preparation-a-loral-9782340030183.html) (in French).
